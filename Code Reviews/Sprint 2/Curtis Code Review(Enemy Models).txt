Name of the .cs file being reviewed: EnemyModel.cs, GoombaEnemyModel.cs, TurtleEnemyModel.cs

Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Pravesh Khanal

Specific comments on code quality: The abstract EnemyModel class allows for minimal repeated code in the GoombaEnemyModel and TurtleEnemyModel classes.
Since all enemies behave basically the same way, this approach works very well.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
A hypothetical change would be adding another enemy type to the game. The current implementation could very easily support this change. All one would
need to do is create a new class inheriting from EnemyModel. In this class, one would only have to get the right textures and animation frames to
implement the new enemy.
