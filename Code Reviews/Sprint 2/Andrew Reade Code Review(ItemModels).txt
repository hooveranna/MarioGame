Specific comments on code quality: The abstract class ItemModel.cs helps to minimize the code repeated between each class, as all items
function similarly, as they all are picked up by the player and all except the coin do something to change the state. Because the MarioModel
class handles transformations when obtaining an item, this design works well for the items.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
One change that could be made would be to add another item, such as the poison mushroom from some of the later Mario games. To implement this
item, one would only have to create a new class (say, PoisonMushroomModel), have it implement ItemModel, then add an update and draw method.
Then all that would be needed would be the textures and animation frames, and MarioModel have a method added, then the implementation would be
complete.
