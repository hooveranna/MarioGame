Specific comments on code quality: The goal of the classes, to provide a class that handles all inputs from the keyboard and 
gamepad, makes sense, and all of names of variables and methods are clear as to what is contained or performed by each, 
respectively. Breaking up all of the functions if the class into functions provides logical function, with each one's function 
being amply described by its name alone, while also not being overly long or complex. The only method that is somewhat of an 
exception is the update method, as the method is quite long compared to the others, an issue that could easily be fixed by 
adding two more methods, one for each of the held keys and the pressed keys, though the issue is not problematic toward the 
function of the class as a whole.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not 
easily support that change: one change that could be made to the game is adding functionality to keys or buttons that occurs when 
they are released. This function could easily be supported by this current implementation by adding in an else if statement on line 
60 of KeyboardController or line 71 of GamePadController, which would check if the the dictionary of released commands, which would 
for instance be named releaseCommands, contains that key or button, and then execute the command dictated by that key.
