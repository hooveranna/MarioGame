Specific comments on code quality: Checkpoint implementation makes logical sense seeing how it is implemented in the collision detection, but there is a decent amount from the ICollidable interface that isn't really applicable for this type. Because of this, there is probably a way to simplify the required methods into something more usable, making it easier to understand what is actually accomplished by the structure.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change: If there are other structures that need to implement this concept for collisions, this class does not allow for easy re-implimentation. That would be a smart thing to look into, as it would make some of our other classes much more simple and consolidated as well.
