Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Pravesh Khanal

Specific comments on code quality: The file itself is relatively short, with no overly long and complicated methods
as well as very little repeated code. The only method that is an exception to this somewhat is RewardPointsByHeight,
which has multiple if statements within the method: however, breaking these into methods would be inappropriate given
the else if statements as well as there only being a single line of code withinn each block following the if statement.
There are also many comments that give an accurate description as to what is happening within the class itself, and the
names of the variables and methods give ample description as to their function.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could 
not easily support that change: One change that could be made to the game would be subtracting points if mario lands too
low on the flag, such as within the bottom 17 pixels of the flag. To accomadate this change, only one of the if statements
in the RewardPointsByHeight method would have to be changed by replacing the line adding points with one that subtracts
points, or if the amount of the flag subtracting points were to change, simply edit the number in the if statement.
