Sprint number: 4
Name of the .cs file being reviewed: WarpPipeBlockModel.cs, WarpPipeEnemyModel.cs, WarpPipeItemModel.cs

Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Pravesh Khanal

Specific comments on code quality:Warp pipe inherits from blockmodel, which is a good choice because it 
requires many similar collision responses. WarpPipeEnemyModel has to know about enemy factory, which is unfortunate
but likely necessary. WarpPipeItemModel likewise has to know about item factory.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could 
not easily support that change: One change would be adding more warp pipes to teleport you to different places. This
would be trivial to implement given the classes as they are now.
