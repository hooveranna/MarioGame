Specific comments on code quality: Initially the dictionaries are initialized which is a better approach to to design the controller class than before. The add command and add hold command methods are simple and to the point. Although the Update 
method is simple, it only allows one key to be mapped for one command. Maybe having one key fire multiple commands would be useful.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change: If I wanted to be able to add a key that does several commands at once, I wouldn't be
able to. However, this could be avoided if a command that does multiple things is added without having to rely on one key being pressed to fire multiple commands.
