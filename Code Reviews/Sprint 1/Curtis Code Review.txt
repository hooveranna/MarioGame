Specific comments on code quality: Right now, each individual animated sprite must keep track of
its own animation frames and when to display each frame. This requires a lot of repeated code
and potentially a lot of memory usage.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
One hypothetical change would be to make the animation for the question block longer or shorter.
Under the current implementation, this would actually be very easy to implement since
all that would need to be changed is the "ticksToSkip" variable.
