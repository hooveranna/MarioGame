Specific comments on code quality: During the first impressions, the code seems very well organized based on each individual state.
Upon further inspections, the conditional (if and else if) statements were a bit of a challenge to follow. Usually switch statements can solve this issue.
The game time is used like it is supposed to, but the game ticks are not as easy to visualize than game time in milliseconds.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
If we hypothetically wanted to add another state like sliding state to mario, we can easily add that by adding a simple conditional statement, adding its texture and defining the
conditional variables on the top of the file. Looking at this factory, perhaps even creating a new factory for block sprites and their states would be helpful.
